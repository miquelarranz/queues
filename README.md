keep track of your daily progress.

## Decisions & Stack

- The app is built with [Remix](https://remix.run/). I wanted to give a try to the framework and live all the end-to-end journey
- The app uses [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style all the components. I'm a big fan of Tailwind!
- The app is connected to a [Supabase](https://supabase.io/) database for now. 
I will manage authentication there as well. This is a temporal approach, I plan to work on the server side at some point with 
Golang or another new technology to me.

## Development

Run the dev server:

```shellscript
yarn dev
```
